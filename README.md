Automated Loan Prediction System Using DecisionTree And SVM Classifiers 

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems with the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Data is fed to the machines, and different algorithms are used to build ML models to train the machines on data. The choice of algorithm depends on the type of data at hand. Machine Learning is used in many areas from automating mundane tasks to offering intelligent industries in every sector to try to benefit from it.

Prediction :- Machine learning can also be used in prediction systems. Considering the loan example, to compute the probability of a fault, the system will need to classify the available data in groups.

Image recognition and Speech Recognition  :- Machine learning can be used for face detection in an image as well. Speech Recognition is the translation of spoken words into the text. It is used in voice searches and more. Voice user interfaces include voice dialing, call routing, and appliance control. It can also be used for simple data entry and the preparation of structured documents.

Medical diagnoses — ML is trained to recognize cancerous tissues.

Financial industry and trading — companies use ML in fraud investigations and credit checks

With the advancement in urbanization and employment, there has been an increase in the number of people that are applying for bank loans but the bank has its limited assets which it has to grant to limited people only. So with this increment, finding out to whom the loan can be granted which will be a safer option for the bank is an important and a crucial process. So in this project we are going to reduce this risk factor of selecting the best client/candidate so banks and lending firms can save, secure and protect bank assets, and reduce exploitation of their efforts.

For this we will take publicly available dataset, that will contain various categories e.g. Data of the previous records of the people to whom the loan was granted before. On the basis of this dataset, particularly on the basis of the records, we will train our machine learning model. We will also perform data cleaning, so as to remove all the unwanted data and find out the missing data and assign them value. 

The dataset will be divided into 2 parts i.e. training dataset and testing dataset. The machine model will be trained on a training dataset and testing of our model will be done on the testing dataset. 

The main objective of our project is to predict the percentage  of whether assigning the loan to a particular person will be safe or not.This project aims to develop a robust module for predicting a client's chances of loan approval. The features used for prediction are considered to be available at the time of loan origination and thus do not leak any information from the future.
